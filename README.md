## Projects

### The GitHub History of the Scala Language 

<li><a href="https://github.com/eren-darici/datacamp-projects/tree/master/The%20GitHub%20History%20of%20the%20Scala%20Language">In this project</a>, I read in, cleaned up, and visualized the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). To find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.</li>
<br>

### The Android App Market on Google Play
<li>Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. <a href = "https://github.com/eren-darici/datacamp-projects/tree/master/The%20Android%20App%20Market%20on%20Google%20Play">In this notebook</a>, I've done a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. I took a look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.</li>

### TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game
<li><a href="https://github.com/eren-darici/datacamp-projects/tree/master/TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game">In this notebook</a>, I've cleaned and explored data from SuperBowl find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other.</li>

### A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners
<li>The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. <a href="https://github.com/eren-darici/datacamp-projects/tree/master/A%20Visual%20History%20of%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winners">In this notebook</a>, I've explored and visualized Nobel Prize Winners.</li>
